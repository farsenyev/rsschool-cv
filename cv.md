**Kata from CodeWars (Count the smiley face!)**

*Given an array (arr) as an argument complete the function countSmileys that should return the total number of smiling faces.*

**Rules for a smiling face:**

*Each smiley face must contain a valid pair of eyes. Eyes can be marked as **: or ;**. A smiley face can have a nose but it does not have to. Valid characters for a nose are **- or ~***
*Every smiling face must have a smiling mouth that should be marked with either **) or D***

        let arr = [':D',':~)',';~D',':)']
        let c = []
        let counter = 0
        for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i ++){
            c = arr[i].split('')
            return c
            if (c.includes((':' || ':') || ('-' || '~') || (')' || 'D'))){
                counter ++
